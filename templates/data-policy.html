      information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to provide
      and support the Mastery Products.
      Here's how:
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 18px; line-height: inherit;"><b>Provide,
          personalize and improve our Products.</b></div>
      <div>We use the
        information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalize features
        and content and make suggestions for you on and off our Products. To create personalized Products
        that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections and activities based on the data we collect and
        learn from you and
        others; how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places, or things you're
        connected to and interested in on and off our Products.

                devices:</b> We connect information about your activities on
              different Mastery Products and devices to provide a more tailored
              and consistent experience on all Mastery Products you use, wherever
              you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on
              Mastery that includes people you follow on Mastery or communicate
              with using Messenger. We can also make your experience more
              seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration
              information (such as your phone number) from one Mastery Product
              when you sign up for an account on a different Product.<div class="mvm uiP fsm"></div>

              near-to provide, personalize and improve our Products for you and others.
              Location-related information can be based on things like precise
              device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses,

    <blockquote>
      <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;">We work with
        third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use
        Mastery Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to
        operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We
        don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose
        strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we
        provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:</div>
      <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;"><b>Partners
          who use our analytics services.</b></div>

        aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand
        how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other
        content on and off the Mastery Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram
        business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who
        viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate
        demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with
        their Page or account.</div>
      <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;">
        <b>Measurement partners.</b>
      </div>
      <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;">We share
        information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and
        measurement reports to our partners.</div>
      <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;"><b>Partners
          offering goods and services in our Products.</b></div>
      <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;">When you
        subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our
        Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and
        other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to
        complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.</div>
      <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;"><b>Vendors
          and service providers.</b></div>

        information about me?</b></h2>
    <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;">We provide you
      with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data.</div>
    <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;">We store data
      until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Mastery Products, or
      until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case
      determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is
      collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For
      example, when you search for something on Mastery, you can access and delete that
      query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is
      deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for
      account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless
      otherwise stated.</div>
    <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;">When you delete
      your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your
      photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later.
      Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't
      be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop
      using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead.</div><br><br>
    <h2 style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal;"><b>V. How do we respond to legal
        requests or prevent harm?</b></h2>
    <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;"> We access,
      preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others: <ul class="uiList _4of _4kg"

        <li>
          <div class="fcb">In response to a legal request (like a search warrant,
            court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law
            requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from
            jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith
            belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,
            affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with
            internationally recognized standards.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="fcb">When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to:
            detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products,
            violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal
            activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or
            Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or
            regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For
            example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information
            from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to
            prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="mvm uiP fsm"></div> Information we receive about you (including
      financial transaction data related to purchases made with Mastery) can be accessed
      and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or
      obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of
      our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from
      accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse
      or other term violations.
    </div><br><br>
    <h2 style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal;"><b>VI. How will we notify you of
        changes to this policy?</b></h2>
    <div class="mvm uiP fsm" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit;">We'll notify you
      before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the
      revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products. </div><br><br>
