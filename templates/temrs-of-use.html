              discover, and share.</b><br> People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared
            experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others
            care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to
            you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and
            offering ways for you to experience Mastery, based on things you and others do on and off Mastery.</div>
